
client's scenario:

1. the car demonstrated several standout capabilities, including driving to all corners of the test track enclosure. It navigated around several obstacles celebrated by huge cheers from the audience.

2. It even stopped suddenly when a childâ€™s toy was launched in the driving path during the demonstration. 

3. The WhizBot demonstrated what other driverless car manufacturers had yet to achieve: positive control in unpredictable situations.

4. began to accelerate uncontrollably

5. the car started to play random music and sounds that could be heard over the loudspeaker.

6. The car completely shut down and the in-car display flashed a glaring error message.
	- hacking?
	- code error
-----------------------------------

possible factors on what went wrong:

1. oversight of implementation of codes[4,5,6]
	- insuffucient control parameters
	- behavior of the car was designed on a specific environment(not flexible)

2. network security[6]

3. no CB to pentest the security. (no countermeasures)[6]

4. Lidar wasn't used efficiently on 1.0

5. AI used on 1.0 wasn't enough


------------------------------------
clients view:

1. Whiz Dynamics is unclear as to what caused the WhizBot 1.0 to fail during the launch
